        <p>In Japan Toad is known as Kinopio. He is a fictional character that appears in the Nintendo's Mario franchise. Toad was created by japenese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. 
            He is portrayed as a citizen of the Muchroom Kingdom and is one of Princess Peach's most loyal attendants. They are usually seen as non-player character who provides assistance 
            to mario and his friends. Toad takes center stage and appears as a protagonist in Super Mario Bros. 2, Waeio's Woods, and Super Mario 3D World. While toad is the name of an
             individual, it also refers to their entire race. In early games, the species was called Mushroom Retainers, in Japan they were called Kinoko-zoku, literally translating to
              "mushroom people".</p>

    <h2>Concept and Creation</h3>
        <p>Toad and the mushroom people were first seen in the game Super Mario Bros. where the species was revealed to comprise the majority of the population of the Mushroom Kingdom, as 
        well as the Mushroom Kingdom. Toad's design was made directly from the power-up, the Super Mushroom, as well as the game's general association with mushrooms. Shigery Miyamoto, the
        the creator of the Mario franchise, reasons that Toad's creation was that of being a character that has simplistic design; yet, still appears cute and lovely and pleasing to everybody.
        In the game, the peaceful Toad of the Mushroom Kingdom had been turned into various objects such as bricks and pipes by the evil King Bowser; however, some of Princess Toadstool's 
        loyal servants known as the "Mushroom Retainers," were simply kidnapped.

    <section id="Characteristics">
    <h2>Characteristics</h4>
        <p>Though Toad's signature mushroom cap is a hat in the non-canon Mariocartoons, Super Mario Odyssery producer Yoshiaki Koizumi confirmed that since tthe creation of the character in 
            1985, the cap was intended to be part of his head. During an interview in 2014, Nintendo director Koichi Hayashida who produced the game Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, revealed that
            the appearance of a toad does not represent his gender, explaining it has never been decided what gender could be associated with any toad. He clarifies later that the gender of Toads
            will remain a mystery.

    <section id="Abilities">
    <h2>Abilities</h5>
        <p>Through the various games that Toad is playable in, he has been shown with different unique abilities that differ from the other characters in the series. In Super Mario Bros. 2, the game 
            describes him as being the strongest and fstest character in the game with 5 out of 5 stars each, but with a weak humping ability, rated at 2 stars. In Wario's Woods, Toad has the unique 
            ability to run up walls and make strong kicks. Toas is once again giver superhuman strength in the game, as he is able to lift and throw enemies around; however, these abilities have not 
            been seen since the game. In New Super Mario Bros. Wii, Toad shares many of the moves and abilities of Mario and Luigi, such as the ground pound and wall jumping as representing by the 
            yellow and blue Toads.
